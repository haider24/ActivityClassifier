Activity Classifier classifies the activity of a person based on wrist worn accelerometer readings.
These activities include walking, sitting, lying and climbing stairs. The classifier is implemented in
Python using scikit-learn. Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for
the Python programming language. This report includes the methodology adopted for training data
set using different algorithms, a comparison of the performance of these algorithms and predictions
made on unseen data by using of the algorithms whose performance was better than the other
algorithms.
